## Bridge
- Bridge. has features which aid in the development of Behavior Packs, but which require extra information to be stored. This information is stored in the Bridge cache. When you edit a file, the file compiles down to a Minecraft-Readable format. Therefor, you must __always__ use Bridge to edit Behavior Pack files and you must __always__ push all files within the "bridge" folder in the Behavior Pack you are editing, otherwise this information is lost.

## Misc
- __Always__ use lower snake case
- Use folders to your advantage, they help keep packs neat and group related files together
