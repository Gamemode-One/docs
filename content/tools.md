# Tools

You can find notes on the tools we use here.

## bridge.

**Repository:** [github.com/bridge-core/bridge.](https://github.com/bridge-core/bridge./)
bridge. has features which aid in the development of Behavior Packs, but which require extra information to be stored. This information is stored in the "bridge. cache". When you edit a file, the file compiles down to a Minecraft-Readable format. Therefor, you must **always** use bridge. to edit Behavior Pack files and you must **always** push all files within the "bridge" folder in the Behavior Pack you are editing, otherwise this information is lost.

## Amulet-Palette-Map

**Repository:** [github.com/byAdam/Amulet-Palette-Map](https://github.com/byAdam/Amulet-Palette-Map)
**Related Slack Thread:** [Gamemode One Slack](https://gamemodeone.slack.com/archives/CPEGSMLRZ/p1605713765288900)
