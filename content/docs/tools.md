## bridge.

bridge. has features which aid in the development of Behavior Packs, but which require extra information to be stored. This information is stored in the "bridge. cache". When you edit a file, the file compiles down to a Minecraft-Readable format. Therefor, you must **always** use bridge. to edit Behavior Pack files and you must **always** push all files within the "bridge" folder in the Behavior Pack you are editing, otherwise this information is lost.
